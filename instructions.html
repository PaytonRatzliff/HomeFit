				1. What kind of filter do you have? Start by turning off the furnace. Remove the existing furnace filter, which will be located inside the furnace or inside the return air vent. Look for an arrow on the filter indicating airflow direction. Using a permanent marker, draw the airflow direction on the outside of the furnace, so you'll always know the right way to install the filter. Then note the furnace filter size, which will be printed on the cardboard frame.

				2. Get the right replacement. Furnace filters are sold at home centers, hardware stores, and online. Disposable ones are typically 1 or 2 inches thick. Check our Ratings of furnace filters, also known as whole-house air filters, for a right-sized model that was effective at removing dust, pollen, and smoke when air passed through it at both high and low speeds. We also test thicker furnace filters, some up to 5 inches, and they often provide superior air cleaning. But if your furnace isn’t already equipped to handle a thicker filter, it will need to be modified by an HVAC professional.

				3. Install the new filter. Look for the markings that tell you which side of the filter should face the furnace. Then slide the filter back into place and replace any cover that goes over it. Keep a record of the date so that you’ll know when it’s time to change the furnace filter again.
